# Recipe filter webapp

Webapp that searches recipes given a selection of ingredients available in a fridge. It also allows the user to upload new recipes on the server. Solo project in first year of Design Engineering studies.

You feel like you have nothing in your fridge and don't have time to do grocery shopping? This WebApp is for you! Indeed, the app gives you recipes according to what you have in your fridge. Each user can also add recipes to the server in order to enrich the app content! It was my frist project covering both front-end and the back-end. Being able to implement such a project in a few weeks was personally an exciting achievement!
